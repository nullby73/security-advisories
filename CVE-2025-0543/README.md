## Technical Details

A vulnerability has been identified in the SetupSVC service, which runs at irregular intervals. During execution, it attempts to launch an executable from a user-writable directory. Additionally, two non-existent DLLs are getting loaded from another user-writable directory and can be hijacked. Placing a malicious file in place of one of these files leads to arbitrary code execution as SYSTEM with the next execution of the service.
